## The problems

### The impact on the current school system from capitalist forces
The post-industrial school teaches people to be good workers. To listen to your boss and not have any ideas. It doesn't promote thinking about how to change society and the problems with capitalism.  We should be teached how to think critically and to form our own ideas. We get teached what the capitalists want us to get teached. That is to sit quietly on your place and do what your boss tells you to do without question.

### The control that social media has on the current student 
Social media in the 21st century has destroyed students. It has made everyone so much more  connected yet distant that we don't recognise each other anymore. We are one person on social media and one in real life. According to [a experiment in 2018](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751), social media can make us feel lonely. Feeling lonely isn't good for a student's mental health. Schools should instead focus on the mental health of the student and should offer free therapy and solutions for people with bad mental health.

### Homework
Homework is another problem. It makes student's minds constantly full of their homework. It makes the student's stressed and worsens their mental health.

## Why it's a problem

### Society

#### Inequality
Capitalists would thrive of a workforce made out of people who only follow instructions. This in turn would lead to more inequality as the workforce knows only to get used by the capitalist. The proletariat would suffer for generations to come as the next generation comes and experiences the same thing.  

#### Suffering
In school the students would suffer. They would be lonely and depressed. This would in turn cause the working class to be less productive and we would have another economic crash.

## The ideal school

### Homework
Homework would put extra stress on the students. Homework is volountary but still always an option. The homework is also not exactly identical to what you did at school but still not harder. If you didn't remember how you did from school or if you are working form home you should have a walktrough of some of the problems.

### Classes
Classes is always based on skill instead of age. You also have multiple parallell classes where you can choose which one you're in as long as they want you there. The class you are moving to is  going to hold a democratic vote with 3 alternatives: Allow, Disallow and neutral. The vote is going to be anonymous and you have to get a 60% super majority. If the class wishes to kick out a student they can also do that with a 60% super majority. Each class would then be naturally form to be like minded. If a group of students want to create a new class they can do so whenever they like.

### Democracy
Every student should be aware about the schools decision if they want to. They should also have a vote in every decision. This helps the students feel heard and wanted. The vote would be done by one person per class and the class would first have to agree on the issue and then the represantative would lay their vote. This would take place after school and it's volountary.

### Volountary
Every student has the right to go to school if they so choose. At the same time it's volountary, just like many other things, to appear to every class. If the student do not wish to show up, they don't have to. Of course you have to have some knowledge from a previous lesson to get to the next one but instead of a linear learning you can watch online if there is anything you've missed. This also makes it required for the teacher to record their lessons.

### Difficulty
Every student can choose what difficulty they study at.

## How to achivie this

### The wider society
If the rest of society would get rid of the capitalist system then we wouldn't have capitalist forces affecting the school system. Social media is also dependent on capitalism as it's owned and funded by big companies. These companies also make it harder to share socialist ideas on social media by not recommending them to people. If we solve the rest of society school would solve itself.
