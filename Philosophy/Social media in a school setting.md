## Consequences
Social media can shorten students attention span by making them watch short videos. If students can't get a kick of dopamine from a video or picture we can just skip and hope for another dopamine kick. Almost every social media platform is made for money and to control its user. For example tiktok just launches you into a stream of videos that the algorithm has made to grab your attention. The more attention they take, the more money they get. If it doesn't grab you immediately then you will scroll away to something else. This will shorten your attention span which can severely decrease productivity at school.
