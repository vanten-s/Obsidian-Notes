## Intro

When writing [[The Perfect School System]] i realised that this whole age has many consequences and can cause bullying. In this age it's almost impossible for schools to prevent cyberbullying, mental health issues and often physical health issues.

The modern teen has a small attention span because of tiktok, eating disorders because of social media such as Instagram, microplastics in their good damn blood and they are weak. The high demand of energy makes high amount of polution. Cars release massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere and the earth is about to die. Entire ecosystems die and the blood is in our hands. 

Many people in our society works with things that they feel isn't important for himself or the society as a whole. This can make them feel worthless, decrease motivation and is a waste of useful labour. We need to go back to a more primitive lifestyle to make get rid of these worthless jobs. 

## What we are already doing to prevent destruction

We are not doing enough today to prevent climate change. Our public health is still rapidly declining. We are not trying our best and the big corporations are lying. Some of the most optimistic predictions still say that we are dead by 2050. The winter 2022 has already made inflation extremely bad. Many people cant afford housing and some can't even pay for their food. 

## Capitalisms role in all of this

Capitalism is not making our situation better.
