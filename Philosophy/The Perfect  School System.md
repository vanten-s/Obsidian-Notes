## The problems

### The impact on the current school system from capitalist forces
The post-industrial school teaches people to be good workers. To listen to your boss and not have any ideas. It doesn't promote thinking about how to change society and the problems with capitalism.  We should be teached how to think critically and to form our own ideas. We get teached what the capitalists want us to get teached.

### The control that social media has on the current school 
Social media in the 21st century has destroyed school. It has made everyone so much more  connected yet distant that we don't recognise each other anymore. We are one person on social media and one in real life. According to [a experiment in 2018](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751), social media can make us feel lonely.
