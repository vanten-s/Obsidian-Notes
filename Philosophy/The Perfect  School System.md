## The problems

### The impact on the current school system from capitalist forces
The post-industrial school teaches people to be good workers. To listen to your boss and not have any ideas. It doesn't promote thinking about how to change society and the problems with capitalism.  We should be teached how to think critically and to form our own ideas. We get teached what the capitalists want us to get teached. That is to sit quietly on your place and do what your boss tells you to do without question.

### The control that social media has on the current student 
Social media in the 21st century has destroyed students. It has made everyone so much more  connected yet distant that we don't recognise each other anymore. We are one person on social media and one in real life. According to [a experiment in 2018](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751), social media can make us feel lonely. Feeling lonely isn't good for a student's mental health. Schools should instead focus on the mental health of the student and should offer free therapy and solutions for people with bad mental health.

### Homework
Homework is another problem. It makes student's minds constantly full of their homework. 

## Why it's a problem

### Society

#### Inequality
Capitalists would thrive of a workforce made out of people who only follow instructions. This in turn would lead to more inequality as the workforce knows only to get used by the capitalist. The proletariat would suffer for generations to come as the next generation comes and experiences the same thing.  

#### Suffering
In school the students would suffer. They would be lonely and depressed. This would in turn cause the working class to be less productive and we would have another economic crash.

## The solutions

### The wider society
If the rest of society would get rid of the capitalist system then we wouldn't have capitalist forces affecting the school system. Social media is also dependent on capitalism as it's owned and funded by big companies. These companies also make it harder to share socialist ideas on social media by not recommending them to people. If we solve the rest of society school would solve itself.
